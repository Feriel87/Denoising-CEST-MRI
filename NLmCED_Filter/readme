### Non Local mean Coherence Enhancing Diffusion filter (NLmCED) ###
NLmCED filter is a new method based on combination between two filters such as the Non-Local mean filter and the Anisotropic Diffusion tensor method with an estimator of noise Rician in in MR images.
The NLM filter is a technique that utilizes similarity between image patches to reduce noise. It replaces each pixel with a weighted average of similar patches in the image, effectively preserving edges and fine details while reducing noise.

On the other hand, anisotropic diffusion is a diffusion-based filter that selectively smooths an image while preserving strong edges. It achieves this by diffusing the image in a manner that is guided by the local gradient information.

By combining these two filters, NLmCED can benefit from the noise reduction capabilities of the NLM filter while maintaining the edge-preserving characteristics of anisotropic diffusion. This hybrid approach often produces superior results by effectively reducing noise while preserving important image structures and details.
